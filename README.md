# live-vote-ml
The machine learning component of the LiveVote app.

The provided notebook was used for final model training. Therefore, the only code executed is for loading the augmented images and labels, along with model building and training. 
The deployment metadata is not included here, as there were some errors encountered in Visual Studio Code. 
As a result, we completed the deployment using Google Colab with tflite-support-nightly.
